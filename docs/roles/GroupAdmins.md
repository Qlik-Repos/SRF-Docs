# GroupAdmins

This group of users can manage content for authorised departments / segments

Group Admins can be consumer in a super-set of groups and a Group Admin in a sub-set,
I.e. The user may be able to consume solutions from Sales and HR. However, they can only administer Sales. 
The framework allows for a user to administrate many groups.

The Groups the user is able to administer is assigned via the Custom Property [GroupsWithAccess](../CustomProperties/GroupsWithAccess.md) applied to the User Object within Qlik
