# RolesWithAccess

The RolesWithAccess custom property is used to limit access to particular streams to users who are a member of the Group Assigned.
This can be used in conjunction with [GroupsWithAccess](./GroupsWithAccess.md) to apply more complex authorization scenarios when users must be more privlidged then the base [Consumer](../Roles/Consumers.md)
